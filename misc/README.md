## Spring Training Plan
The [Spring Training Plan](./msg_Spring_Training_Plan.pdf) is a "zero-to-hero" tutorial-like training for Spring. It contains 10 chapters, each with linked resources for learning Spring or Java concepts. The resources refer to Spring Boot 1.x, but all of the concepts apply for Spring Boot 2.x, the biggest differences encountered being that some methods or classes were renamed or split.

You **DO NOT** have to do the steps described in this document as part of the SD Laboratory. It is merely an example where you can find useful resources for learning Spring and also to make an idea how a training at a company looks like. Usually, employees have 2-3 weeks to finish everything and the trainers do 2-3 rounds of code reviews to check their code.
